# What factors affect your travel plan?

## Background from Part I
During the Part I, I received multiple reviews that the analysis of road safety data is more of a presentation of data and would be better if conveyed through a story. It was told to me that the facts are being representedtoo directly and that it needs to be presented in a more subtle way. I spent multiple nights thinking about it and did multiple researches to bring about a topic that could be informative as well as interesting. Since, I had my audience in mind, I thought to change my title from **Road Safety Analysis** to **What factors affect your travel plan?**. More details would be illustrated in the interview findings section in due course of time. 


## Wireframes and Storyboard
To enable my data to communicate a better story, I thought to create a small story on **Storyboard**. My ultimate call to action from the data set selected was to 

  i. make sure that people are aware of the safety standards of the G20 countries  
  ii. people take informed decisions before planning a trip to a country as fatal accidents per million people is a report card of the country's infrastructure  

Since, the story had to be a little subtle, I decided to change my project title. Apart from that, I decided to draw a small story along with wireframes on Storyboard so as to ascertain public reaction. The link to my Storyboard creation is - [https://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboards/sanskritsingh/-factors--affecting-travel-plans-/copy](https://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboards/sanskritsingh/-factors--affecting-travel-plans-/copy). A copy of it is being produced below for ready reference.

## What factors do people actually consider before planning a trip?
According to many researches, the top factors that people consider before planning a trip are as follows:  

1. Correct Season (Right Weather)
2. Budget
3. Travel Companions
4. Reviews / Recommendations
5. Desired travel experience

A graph depicting the above points is given below:

We see that assessing a country's infrastructure system for an individuals **safety and security** is not a top factor affecting a persons travel plan. We can easily get this data from [OECD Website](https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm). However a fine tune analysis for each country shall have to be done

## Interview Script
After a mini brainstorming session, I came up with the following questions to be asked to the reviewes:  

1. Did you know about such an indicator?
2. Did you ever think of a country infrastructure system before planning a trip?
3. Did you find this meaningful?
4. What did you find confusing?
5. What would you have changed?










## Why this data visualization was selected?
The chosen data gives a heads up on the number of fatal accidents happening across the world. It would be a good data visualization to represent the fact over a few graphs and analyze the trends.

## Background
While analyzing a data like this, the source needs to be really genuine and thus I have chosen to get the data from the OECD Website - [https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm](https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm). While comparing the data from across the world, I want to ultimately draw a comparison between the data from the G7 or G20 countries which are the most developed countries in the world.

## Outline of the project
There are countries which spend about 1/3rd of their total annual budget on the country's infrastructure. Despite the huge amounts of investment in the road infrastructure sector acorss the world, I believe that number of fatal accidents would be a better measure of the actual road safety standard across the countries. For the sake of clarity - "Road accidents are measured as a number of persons injured and **deaths due to road accidents**, whether immediate or within 30 days of the accident, and excluding suicides involving the use of road motor vehicles. This indicator is measured in number of accidents, **number of persons**, and million vehicles." The main theme behind this data visualization is to make sure that audience is engaged and to change their thinking (or give them an idea about road safety across the world). One of the main ways of doing that would be to use persuasive techniques. 

*Some of the interesting trends that I could see was that around 1994 fatal accidents were much higher in European countries compared to Asian countries. However, by the year 2018, most the EU countries have fatal road accidents much lesser than most of the Asian countries. Further, the European standards are much better than rest of the world including USA and south American countries. I have also plotted two separate time analysis graphs for USA and Korea showing how they have improved and reduced the number of accidents through better technologies and public policies*. Some of the **initial sketches / wireframes** are show below for reference.

## The Data
**I have chosen to get the data from the OECD Website - [https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm](https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm)**

There will be no need to recreate data as the data is already collected by the governments of each countries as this is a reflective of the country's safety standards. The data is available in .csv format which can easily be downloaded onto my personal computer. I will do some data cleaning before actually using the data. Interesting trends would be found and would be presented so that the final story engages the audience. Also, for the avoidance of doubt, it is wise to mention here that the data that is being used is public and there would be no copyright issues later. A copy of the data can be accessed using the link - [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15BHT8GnY6O_BJGjePbUrLQ_zqlklmAX7](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15BHT8GnY6O_BJGjePbUrLQ_zqlklmAX7)

## Method and Medium
As mentioned in the Outline of the Project, the main aim is to keep the audience engaged by showing unique and amusing trends of fatal accidents around the world. This will be more like a **report card of a country's infrastructure system**. The story would be built using **Shorthand**. Appropriate graphs and trends would be analysed using **Tableau and Datawrapper**. Both these softwares were a part of this course. 

Tableau has been very useful while analyzing what type of chart / graph to use and thus interesting trends would be found using **Tableau**. I have particularly found **Datawrapper** very useful and handy while creating a graph / chart. The options available are super interactive and thus makes it easier to convey a story once the trend is already known. This will be my main method going forward and hopefully, the final project would come out to be nice (as envisaged)!
