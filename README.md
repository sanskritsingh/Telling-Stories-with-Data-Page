## About Me

My name is Sanskrit Singh (He/His/Him). I am from the northern part of India. I am a civil engineer by profession and currently pursuing my Graduate Program from the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. I love playing tennis and enjoy travelling to learn about different cultures. I am really excited about the Telling Stories with Data course as this would enable me to visualize better which would help me no matter which field I choose to pursue. This course will help me to broaden my horizon and explore the creative side within me. Looking to learn from the best and my fellow course mates. 

## What I wish to learn

I wish to learn more about data visualization so that I can make good use of the transportation data and effectively portray them to convey a story. There is immense amount of data pertaining to the traffic industry and I hope this course will enable me to present data well. In the long run, I would want a fulfilling career in the Transportation / Green Infrastructure consulting industry.

## Portfolio

The first visualization is regarding percentage of money spent by countries on pension schemes compared to percentage of population above 65 years
