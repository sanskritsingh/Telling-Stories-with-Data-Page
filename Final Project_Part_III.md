## Review of Project Part II in Class
The Project Part II was presented to my fellow classmates in the breakout toom and received a couple of more suggestions:

| Sl. No. | Name  | Suggestion | Final intended Action |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Rakshanda | She asked me a question - "What to do if you meet with an accident in a foreign country" | I tried to research on this and found a few suggestions and decided to finally include that in my final Shorthand presentation |
| 2 | B Crittenden | She suggested to reduce the number of final graphs as it is difficult to read so many graphs together | I accepted this suggestion and decided to use two most relevant graphs in the final Shorthand Presentation |
| 3 | Rakshanda and B Crittenden | Both of then thought that the CDC report for leading causes of injusry deaths for US Citizens was a graph which speaks a lot about the issue and to give more stress on that graph | I decided to use it during the first few slides of the shorthand presentation itself |
| 4 | B. Crittenden | Refine further the call to action | I decided to make people aware about the data available on the OECD website and how to reach if one meets with an accident in a foreign country |

## Shorthand
After crystallizing the changes, I started with the preparation of presentation omn Shorthand. Shorthand is pretty interactive and easy to use especially when you want to have multiple layers of media and have background scrollmation. Part I and Part II gave me an idea of how the presentation should look like and the further comments by my fellow classmates even refined the content.

I tried to put a footnote of all the links that I used for the creation of the presentation. I also put up a Bibliography in the end and put up all the links used for the creation of the presentation. Few pictures were sources from Google.

Overall I just focused on the final output that was decided in the course of time. Suggestions from both Part I and Part II were actively accepted.

## Visualization
There are around 4 visualizations were used in the final presentation. A couple of them were sourced from the data collected from [OECD Website](https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm). The other graphs have been drawn on Datawrapper and have the source mentioned on them. 

## Final Call to Action
The final call to action was decided after I decided that all people who are travel enthisiuats are my target audience for the final data story

1. What to do before you plan your travel?
- Make sure that people are aware of the **safety standards** of the country you are planning to travel
- Details about road accidents and fatal accidents can be found out on the **OECD Website**


2. What to do in case you are involved in an accident internationally?  
- Carry travel insurance
- Contact the local police
- Contact the [local embassy](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/contact-us/Emergencies-Abroad.html)
  From the U.S. & Canada  - 1-888-407-4747
