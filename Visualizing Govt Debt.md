The data can be presented through a graph as follows:

Compared to the last data, where one could only see a comparison of ventral governemtn debt for the year 2018, the graph below gives a cpmparison of the graphs of different countries over the years. The reader can easily assess whether the central governemtn debt is increasing or decreasing over the years for a specific country. A tool like Fluorish makes visualization of such data super easy!

Another way to depict the same data using a stacked column chart is given below. Some people might find this easer to comprehend.

On a more specific note, if we want to analyze the central governement debt for USA, it can be seen below:

The differtent methods to visualize data can be seen from the graphs above. The color coding has been followed and contrasting colors have been used to represent the data. The first graph represents data into a bar chart for the year 2018 (all countries included). The data is easy to comprehend and is for a given year. The same data can be used for generating different types of graph as per the requirement. Similarly, the second graph gives a tabulation of each of the country. This graph does not compare one country from another country but gives us an assessment of ventral government debt for that specific country. This can be a great graph when we want to go into the details of a particular country or want to analyze the pattern for a specific country.

The third graph given above basically represents the same data in a stacked column chart. Some people find it easier to comprehend and thus while representing data, all types through which data can be represented / visualized should be kept in mind. This graph makes it super easy to monitor that a country like Estonia has very low central government debt while Japan on the other hand has huge central government debt. While wantint to assess the same for a specific country over the years, the country USA has been chosen and represented in the graph number 4.  It can be seen that USA has low central government debt till 2007, however, post 2008, the debt has started increasing. Although, the debt has remained stable for the period 2014 to 2019. The idea to represent data as an areachart (streamgraph) was intitially started off as an experiement, but in my opinion, it presents the data for USA really well showing, through the years, how the central debt has increased. Thus, I think, my experiment worked!!
