# The final project is to give an analysis of the road safety across the globe!

## Why this data visualization was selected?
The chosen data gives a heads up on th number of fatal accidents happeining across the world. It would be a good data visulization to represent the fact over a few graphs and analyze the trends.

## Background and Data
While analyzing a data like this, the source needs to be really genuine and thus I have chosen to get the data from the OECD Website - [https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm](https://data.oecd.org/transport/road-accidents.htm). While comparing the data from across the world, I want to ultimately draw a comparison between the data from the G7 or G20 countries which are the most developed countries in the world.

## Outline of the project
Despite the amount of investment in the road infrastructure sector, I believe that number of fatal accidents would be a better measure of the actual road safety standard across the countries. For the sake of clarity - "Road accidents are measured in terms of the number of persons injured and deaths due to road accidents, whether immediate or within 30 days of the accident, and excluding suicides involving the use of road motor vehicles. This indicator is measured in number of accidents, number of persons, per million inhabitants and million vehicles." The main theme behind this data visualization is to make sure that audience is engaged and to change their thinking (or give them an idea about road safety across the world). One of the main ways of doing that would be to use persuasive techniques. 

Some of the interesting trends that I could see was that around 1994 fatal accidents were much higher in European countries compared to Asian countries. However, by the year 2018, most the EU countries have fatal road accidents much lesser than most of the Asian countries. Further, the European standards are much better than rest of the world including USA and south American countries. I have also plotted two separate time analysis graphs for USA and Korea showing how they have improved and reduced the number of accidents through better technologies and public policies. Some of the initial wireframes are show below for reference.
