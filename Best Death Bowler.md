##Who is the best Death Bowler in Ome Day Internationls?
#The below data gives us a representation of the best death bowler (who has taken maximum wickets between the 40th and 50th overs in ODI starting from 01 Jan 2017 to 15 May 2019!

The graph below was posted in on of the cricket daily website. There are many things that I did not like about the graph. There are multiple thing wrong with this dataset. They are: 
First, the color scheme is absolutely wrong for this graph. Two near identical colors have been stacked together which results in "not so clear" representation of the data. 

Second, the wrong data sets have been used to portray the graph. The values on the X axis are Wickets and Average. However, a person will not be able to determine who is the best death bowler until and unless he has access to certain other qualification data like (minimum number of matches played, average wickets per match, runs given during the tenure etc.). Thus, this questions the useful and completeness aspect of the graph. 

Third, also in my opinion there should be an indication as to which country do they play for (this would in turn tell us that whether they are playing on batting friendly or bowling friendly pitches). For example - a bowler to take wickets in England would be easier than taking wickets in New Zealand as pitches in England have green top which is favorable for swing and seam movement whereas NZ have the smallest grounds in the world. 

In my opinion, I will probably use different indicators to prove the logic and also use better color scheme. A completely different portrayal of the graph can also turn out to be a good option! 

I assume using a different type of chart to express the data would solve the purpose. Also, a change in the measures to be plotted on the graph. A change in the color scheme. The most important thing is to highlight the player - "Pat Cummins" as from the data it looks like the one with the highest number is wickets is the best death bowler. But the truth is that the bowler with the best wickets / match should be accepted as the best death bowler. These small changes will surely improve the graph!

Hence, I have recreated the graph as given below:
