# A take on the best death bowler in the world? A short summart through different graphs!

## Why this data visualization was selected?
The chosen data visualization is from the world of Cricket (a very popular sports in the Asian sub-continent). The data is typing to convey a story regarding the best bowler during the death overs (last 10 overs of the match (a cricket match is a 50 over game for each side)). The topic is of interest to me as I have been following the sports since my childhood and have also represented my native state in this sports.

# Who is the best Death Bowler in One Day Internationals?
## The below data gives us a representation of the best death bowler (who has taken maximum wickets between the 40th and 50th overs in ODI starting from 01 Jan 2017 to 15 May 2019! The source for the data and graph is - [https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/who-are-odi-cricket-s-best-death-bowlers-1121953](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/who-are-odi-cricket-s-best-death-bowlers-1121953)

The graph given above was posted in on of the cricket daily website. There are many things that I did not like about the graph. There are multiple thing wrong with this dataset. They are: 

First, the color scheme is absolutely wrong for this graph. Two near identical colors have been stacked together which results in "not so clear" representation of the data. 

Second, the wrong data sets have been used to portray the graph. The values on the X axis are Wickets and Average. However, a person will not be able to determine who is the best death bowler until and unless he has access to certain other qualification data like (minimum number of matches played, average wickets per match, runs given during the tenure etc.). Thus, this questions the useful and completeness aspect of the graph. 

Third, also in my opinion there should be an indication as to which country do they play for (this would in turn tell us that whether they are playing on batting friendly or bowling friendly pitches). For example - a bowler to take wickets in England would be easier than taking wickets in New Zealand as pitches in England have green top which is favorable for swing and seam movement whereas NZ have the smallest grounds in the world. 

In my opinion, I will probably use different indicators to prove the logic and also use better color scheme. A completely different portrayal of the graph can also turn out to be a good option! 

I assume using a different type of chart to express the data would solve the purpose. Also, a change in the measures to be plotted on the graph. A change in the color scheme. The most important thing is to highlight the player - "Pat Cummins" as from the data it looks like the one with the highest number is wickets is the best death bowler. But the truth is that the bowler with the best wickets / match should be accepted as the best death bowler. Also, players from each continent would be given a different color so as to give the reader an estimate as to which continent does the player belong to. Player from Asia have been given a different color, players from UK/EU have been given a different color, also players from Australia have been given a different color. These small changes will surely improve the graph!

On drawing the basic wireframes with a pen on paper, I got the following graphs:

Interesting answers to my questions:

Q1. Is the graph easy to understand?  
Answer --> The line chart makes the eye travel too much from one spot to another for the ease of comparison.

Q2. Is there anything that you find confusing in the graph?  
Answer --> The responder suggested that you can use the name in between and present the graphs on opposide sides of the names. That will make the comparison of data easy.

Q3. Which graph do you think is the best out of the 3 wireframes plotted for reference?  
Answer --> One of the person mentioned to use stacked colmumn chart and to use contrasting colors. Other responder strictly suggested to not to use line graph and to go ahead with two different column graphs so that comparison is easy. Since the main objective is to find the bowler with the best wickets / match, the comparison is needed.

Based on the references drawn from the above Q&A and the fruitful discussions I had with my responders, I decided to go ahead with a double column graph and also highlight the bowler where I want the readers eye to go. The main focus is to convey a story that maximum wickets taken does not make one the greatest bowler but having the best wickets / match ratio makes you the best death bowler. I have also tried to use contrasting colors and differentiating players playing from different continents.

Hence, I have recreated the graph as given below:
